My personal Gitea instance experienced massive data loss, so I've briefly been using Github again. Now as of 2025-03-07 I'm switching to SourceHut, taking the responsibility of hosting out of my hands, but providing a much better experience than Github. You can find my profile at https://git.sr.ht/~nebulabc/.
